# Final-Project-Code
# Open any IDE or code editor. I used Visual Studio Code in my project.
# Open the python program file, .txt file of our novel, and the word_counter .txt file
# Run the word_count_program python file and the data should be exported to the word_counter.txt file.
# This new file will display the words/characters and the number of occurrences next to it as a list.
# In the console of the main python program, there should a print of how many seconds it took for the program to execute.
# This program will create the new file called word_counter.txt which will display each word and its occurrences and the time it took for the program to execute in the main console of the word_count_program python file.
